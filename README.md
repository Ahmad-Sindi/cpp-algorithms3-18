# Algorithm Challenge #18 – Intersected Numbers in Matrices (Level 3)

🧮 **Problem Description**
-
This program prints the numbers that appear in **both** of two 3×3 matrices.

The algorithm scans the first matrix and checks whether each element
exists in the second matrix, printing only the shared values.

This is a classic example of **set intersection** applied to matrices.

💡 **What You’ll Learn**
-
- Comparing two matrices element by element
- Reusing search logic across multiple algorithms
- Understanding matrix intersection as a geometric concept
- Applying nested loops for cross-structure comparison
- Designing modular and reusable helper functions

🧩 **Example**
-
**Matrix 1:**

55 77 1

5 24 62

85 7 14

**Matrix 2:**

18 62 24

7 35 55

77 1 45


**Output:**
55 77 1 24 62 7

📂 **File Information**
-
- **Language:** C++
- **File Name:** intersected_numbers_in_matrices.cpp
- **Challenge Number:** #18
- **Level:** 3

💬 **Notes**
-
This challenge builds naturally on previous matrix-based problems such as:
- Searching for a number in a matrix
- Traversing matrices efficiently

However, the main focus here is **relationship between two data structures**,
not just analyzing a single matrix.
